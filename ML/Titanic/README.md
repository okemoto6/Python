## Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster

Entry-level Kaggle's machine learning competition. Full description and dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic
- [Learning_from_disaster_tree_model.ipynb](https://github.com/okemoto6/Python/blob/main/ML/Titanic/Learning_from_disaster_tree_model.ipynb) - first model created, basic tree model with only one data manipulation (age null values replaced with mean age value for each sex in trained model). Accuracy score: 0.55502
- [Learning_from_disaster_tree_model_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/okemoto6/Python/blob/main/ML/Titanic/Learning_from_disaster_tree_model_v2.ipynb) - tree model above improved with including 'sex' column as a model feature. Accuracy score: 0.74162
- [Learning_from_disaster_tree_model_v3.ipynb](https://github.com/okemoto6/Python/blob/main/ML/Titanic/Learning_from_disaster_tree_model_v3.ipynb) - tree model above improved with child/adult column as a model feature. In fact, woman and children had priority in lifeboats entering.
